setup
    direction how to play
  choose a secret word easy start with one, also easy to test 
  
  one player set number of lives 

def ask_user_for_guess
  guess = gets.chomp
end

is guess correct?
    if / else statement 
  compare guess against letters in secret word

  use .chars to break up word into an arr of strings

Possiple goals 
#lives to end the infinate while loop
#comapring imputs to secret 
# print out secret with dashes  

Ideas 

the secret is already divided into an arr of strings so now I need a method that comapires each imput to all the letters in the secret

set the secret as -- dashes then representing each letter, once a letter is right then its replaced with that letter 

Add conditions, count turns, if you solve the puzzle then you are a winner. or if you get to the end and puzzle is not solved but turns are used up they did not win 

could use .include? 
  this worked, but only returns true. I need to find away to compaire the secret and the guess if it matches put it in place of a dash and if not says somthing like 'not the right letter'


  Later Version of Hangman

  use classes to hold the methods 
  within the classes will 

class Greeter
def initialize(name = "World")
 @name = name
 end
def say_hi
 puts "Hi #{@name}!"
 end
 def say_bye
 puts "Bye #{@name}, come back soon"
 end
 end

 greeter = Greeter.new("Pat")
=> @name="Pat">
 greeter.say_hi
Hi Pat!
 greeter.say_bye
Bye Pat, come back soon
